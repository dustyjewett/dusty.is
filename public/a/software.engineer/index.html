                        Given free rein, I would find myself pulled towards the frontend systems. That's almost never the case, and I go where I can make the most impact.
                        While I can build entire systems on my own, I love working on a team. I feed off of the PR process and I love diving deep to explain niche knowledge to new Engineers.

                                Built an integration with Shopify that allows Artists to simplify their inventory maintenance. 
                                Focused on building a system that builds trust with the users by proactively warning users about why they can't do something.
                                Ensured that we kept that trust by providing detailed updates of actions we took on the user's behalf.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Planned and built a system that synchronizes inventory between two retail powerhouses.</li>
                                    <li>Built out admin tools and audit logs to ensure that when one systems stops agreeing with the other, we're able to clearly explain why to the users (like deleting an item from one store but not the other).</li>
                                    <li>Worked with internal Systems Team to be the first full usage of Google Pubsub.</li>
                                    <li>Used Bandcamp's internal-only Ruby framework on the Backend, and Vue on the Frontend.</li>

                                    <li>Lead project to redesign the channel page as an experiment. Rewrote major components to support more centralized data handling and no-compromises, full-experience A/B testing. While the experiment as a whole did not graduate, the systems I built were the foundation for the redesign in late 2019.</li>

Implemented several patterns, including MVVM, which allowed a more structured and contemporary paradigm than provided by Vaadin alone.

                                Architected many of the systems that drove the UI, including a system that could query and cache multiple levels of data, and a navigation system that could handle the complex UI paradigms the designers dreamt up (though the most complex never shipped).<br />
                                Developed many custom UI Components, including a complex and animated breadcrumb bar, TileLists that could handle non-sequential loading of data, and screens that behaved differently based on the state of many different variables (though I argued against the last one, on usability issues, and lost).

Fully developed three separate versions, one fully AIR application, one Hybrid AIR/Android version, and just recently migrated to an AIR/ANE implementation.  With the AIR/ANE nearly finalized, I expect to start development on the iOS version soon.</div>

                        <div class="description">Managed Meetup / User Group for developers in the Seattle Area.  From 2007-2011, group was focused on Flex development.  In 2011, we expanded to include HTML/JS development, changing our name to Seattle Web App Developers in the process. We meet once a month, and I often give short intro-to-X talks, prior to a main speaker.  Usually once or twice a year, I give a longer 2-hour presentation.  I also speak at other meetups, having spoken at the ColdFusion and Android user groups. I stepped down in 2012 after managing the group for 5 years, and now serve as a mentor for the new managers.</div>
